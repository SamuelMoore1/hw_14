## Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

- What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

  - **Answer:** Higher weighted average of precision, recall and f1 score with a training window of 6 months.

- What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

  - New SMA Short: 10
  - New SMA Long: 150

  - **Answer:** Higher weighted average of precision, recall and f1 score with a training window of 6 months.

- Which set of parameters yield the best outcome?

  - **Answer:** The model that yield the highest cumulative returns was the model with the modified training window (i.e., 6 months).
